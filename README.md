Demo Web Scraping Pyday Caacupe 2016

`tripadvisor.py` contains a very simple example of web scraping using requests and beautiful soup to scrape paraguayan restaurants from trip advisor.

`tripadvisor_restaurants_paraguay` folder contains the same example using scrapy. It adds pagination, and shows how to use scrapy's Item and ItemLoaders classes to clean data. To run use: `scrapy crawl restaurants` inside the folder.
